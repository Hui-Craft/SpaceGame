# SpaceGame
This repo will explain the HuiCraft SpaceGame concept.
## The concept
### Storyline
#### The start
You (the player) wake up somewhere at an unknown planet. You don't remember anything (except fot your name). You see a ship. (Your ship.) Stranded and broken. You look inside and take some tools.

You start chopping some trees. Eventually you see someone walking: a villager. The stranger takes you to his village. The villagers need help with something (I don't know what exactly. Make an issue if you have an idea) and you help them.
In return they give you metal/resources to repair your ship. They also let you choose a pet. (A cat or a dog) After a week (in minecraft days) you finally repaired your ship.
The only thing you need is fuel. That's why you started working in the villagers mine. After a day of mining, you ot enough fuel to launch your ship to leave the planet.
You leave the planet.
